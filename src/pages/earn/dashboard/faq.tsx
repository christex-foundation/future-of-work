        question: 'What can I use Superteam Earn for?',
        answer: `Superteam Earn is a platform to get work done from crypto-native talent. This can be in the form of bounties (get the same work done by many people) or hiring freelancers in the form of Project listings. Earn can be used to get any small to medium-scale task done, including but not limited to development, writing, design, research, and product feedback.

      },
      {
        question: 'Are there any hidden charges to publish a listing?',
        answer: `No! Superteam Earn is completely free to use. There are no listing or platform fees.`,
      },
      {
        question: 'How much money do I need to put up?',
        answer: `There's no minimum or maximum limit. However, the reward amount influences visibility — higher-value listings may receive better distribution (via email, Discord, platform discovery, etc.).`,
      },
      {
        question: 'What kind of distribution do sponsors get from Earn?',
        answer: `When you publish a listing on Superteam Earn, it can be distributed across multiple high-visibility channels, including:
<br />
<br />
<strong>1. Homepage:</strong> Your listing will be featured on the Earn homepage, which receives <strong>50,000 monthly active users</strong> actively browsing for work opportunities.
<br />
<strong>2. Discord Bot:</strong> Listings are shared in real-time in relevant Superteam Discord channels across Superteam discords.
<br />
<strong>3. X:</strong> Listings with <strong>rewards over $1,000</strong> are amplified to reach a global audience via Superteam Earn's <a style="color: blue" href="http://x.com/superteamearn" target="_blank">X</a> profile.
<br />
<strong>4. Email Blasts:</strong> Listings may be included in curated newsletters depending on factors like reward size, sponsor reputation, and past engagement reaching, Earn's users' inbox directly.`,
      },
      {
        question: 'How can I get extra distribution for my listing?',
        answer: `Distribution is influenced primarily by the <strong>reward value</strong> and <strong>listing quality.</strong> For example:
<br />
<br />
• Listings with <strong>rewards under $100</strong> are not featured on the homepage.
<br />
• Listings with <strong>rewards above $1,000</strong> are amplified via our <a style="color: blue" href="http://x.com/superteamearn" target="_blank">X</a> and are more likely to be included in <strong>email blasts</strong> and other community channels.
<br />
<br />
<strong>Tip:</strong> Well-written scopes, clear evaluation criteria, and generous prizes tend to get more attention from both the community and the Earn distribution channels.`,
      },
    ],
  },

    title: 'Creating & Managing Listings',
    subsections: [
      {
        question: 'How do I create a new listing?',
        answer: `On your dashboard, click the "Create New Listing" button. You'll be guided to the listing builder page where you can select the type (Bounty or Project), add scope of work, timeline, evaluation criteria, rewards, and more.`,
      },
      {
        question:
          'Do I need to verify my listing before publishing? How can I verify my listing?',
        answer: `<ul class="list-disc space-y-2 pl-5"><li>If you're a <strong>new sponsor</strong>, you'll need to verify your listing before it can be published.</li><li>If you're an <strong>existing sponsor</strong> but your profile has been flagged due to past activity — for example, having listings that already past their deadline and are "In Review" — you'll also be required to complete verification for new listings.</li></ul>
<br />
<strong>How to verify your listing:</strong>
<br />
After publishing your listing, you'll be prompted to fill out a short verification form. This helps us maintain trust on the platform and keep bad actors out. Once verified, your listing will automatically go live.
<br />
<br />
<strong>Pro tip:</strong> For faster verification, get referred by a <strong>Superteam Lead</strong> and mention their name in the <strong>"Reference"</strong> field of the form.
<br />
<em>Note: We aim to complete all verifications within 24 hours.</em>`,
      },
      {
        question: 'Can I edit a listing after it is published?',
        answer: `Yes, listings can be edited after publishing and until the deadline, but we discourage sponsors from making major changes, such as altering the scope of work, eligibility criteria, or judging guidelines, for the sake of fairness and transparency.`,
      },
      {
        question: 'How do I check the status of my listings?',
        answer: `All your listings are shown on your dashboard, each listing is labeled with statuses like Draft, In Progress, In Review, Payment Pending, or Completed. Use filters to sort and manage listings easily.`,
      },
      {
        question: 'Can I duplicate an existing listing?',
        answer: `Yes! Go to the three-dot menu on your dashboard on any previous listing and click <strong>"Duplicate"</strong> to reuse its structure. You can also choose from predefined templates using the <strong>Browse Templates</strong> option while creating a new listing.`,
      },
      {
        question: 'What is the difference between Podium and Bonus spots?',
        answer: `<ol class="list-decimal list-inside space-y-6">

  <strong>Podium:</strong>
  <ul class="list-disc space-y-2 pl-5 mt-2">
    <li>Ranked winners (1st, 2nd, 3rd, etc.). Each position can have a different reward / prize.</li>

      {
        question: 'Where can I see all submissions?',
        answer: `Click on the listing you want to view in your dashboard to see all submissions, or the "Submissions" button along side the title. You'll be able to view submission details like the user's wallet address, email, or application, etc.`,
      },
      {
        question: 'Can I label or categorize submissions?',
        answer: `Yes!

      },
      {
        question: 'What happens if I mark a submission as "Spam"?',
        answer: `Marking a submission as spam deducts one submission credit from the applicant's total credits and flags it in our system.
